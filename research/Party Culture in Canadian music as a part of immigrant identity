Canadian Culture, Music, and Immigration


































Introduction
Often, immigrating to a new country means bringing nothing more than some clothes in a bag, various family or friends, and a bit of money. The typical immigrant is only left with their memories and skills, and their experience in their new country is coloured by their visible membership to an ethnic group. Trying to create an identity for oneself in a new country or culture can be challenging enough, without the added feeling of being a stranger in a strange land. Given the difficulty of transition, immigrants tend to find each other and develop areas of a city into images of home. For second-generation immigrants, these lines are not always so distinct, and as teens try to discover their identity in these culturally dense urban centers of Canada, they find themselves faced with anxieties, difficulties and dilemmas (Daniel A. Yon., 2000). A way to express these emotions is through music, and over the last couple decades Toronto has produced some very famous musicians who are second or even first-generation immigrants. Some of the more notable second-generation Canadian artist to achieve North American, or global fame in recent years are; The Weeknd, and Alessia Cara. The Weeknd, (Abel Makkonen Tesfaye), is a second-generation Ethiopian immigrant born in 1990 who grew up in Scarborough, Ontario. He dropped out of high school in grade 11 and lived in the downtown party scene for a number of years before discovering music and making his debut in 2012. Alessia Cara is a second-generation Italian immigrant born in 1996 who grew up in and still lives in Brampton, Ontario. She is public about her struggles with depression, and identifies as an outcast or anti-social person. However, a common trend that is express through the music of both The Weeknd, and Alessia Cara is that of a party culture that exist amongst young Canadians, in which high school students are exposed to alcohol and drugs at a young age. This paper will explore the perspectives and experiences of second-generation immigrants on party culture as expressed through music and the regions where they grew up.
1.	Music and Party Culture
The two songs that I chose to examine for this article were Here by Alessia Cara and The Fall by The Weeknd. A common theme within these songs are the use and abuse of drugs and alcohol from the perspective of the artists. As defined by The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA] Party Culture, or binge drinking refers to the pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration to 0.08 grams percent or above. For the typical adult this means drinking five or more drinks in a 2-hour time. While smoking weed, cannabis, pot, or marijuana refer to the inhalation of the dried plant until a euphoric effect is felt. These are the two most common substances attributed to party culture. In his music, The Weeknd glamorizes the Rockstar lifestyle, partying all the time with attractive women, spending lots of money, and often while also abusing drugs and alcohol. The typical drugs referenced in his songs are alcohol, marijuana, and sometimes cocaine. In the song The Fall by The Weeknd, he sings about not being afraid of the consequences of alcohol and drug abuse in his day to day life because he has been at rock bottom before. “I’m not scared of the fall/ I’ve felt the ground before” (The Weeknd, 2012) speaking of a brief period of time in his life when he was homeless, partying all the time, and living from one couch to another (Eeels, Josh, 2015). Alessia Cara on the other hand, represents a polarizing perspective of the situation. She sings about having no interest in party culture and how she feels alienated because of this. Singing about being at a party wherein she protests against the use of marijuana and alcohol. In the song Here, Alessia recounts an actual party that she attended at 16 years old where she was so opposed to everything and everyone there that she felt like an outcast and chose to express those feelings through music. “I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room, with people who don't even care about my well-being… please enjoy your party, I'll be here, somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana… Right next to the boy who's throwing up 'cause, he can't take what's in his cup no more” (Alessia Cara, 2015). Lucky for her, it landed her a Grammy as Canada’s first best new artist. These contrasting perspectives are just a glimpse into the life of adolescence in Toronto, Ontario, and across Canada.

2.	Substance Abuse Statistics
According to the Center for Addition and Mental Health (CAMH), the top four substances used by Ontario students aged 15-19 are alcohol at 58%, marijuana at 25%, Non-prescribed use of pain relievers at 17%, and tobacco 11.7%. The average age that teens will begin to experiment with drug use in Canada is 15.7 years old. (Paglia-Boak, A., 2009) There was no significant deviation in the use of marijuana based on income levels or geographical territory relative to population size. (Statistics Canada, 2012). Below is a graphic produced by CAMH which represents trends of substance use by Ontario teenagers over the last 32 years.

 
(Paglia-Boak, A., 2009)
2.1.	Scarborough
There are 575 immigrants from Ethiopia living in Scarborough vs 9,080 in all of Toronto, and a total of 61,315 immigrants in Scarborough. This shows us that of all Ethiopian immigrants in Toronto, only 6.3% of them are in Scarborough. Additionally, Ethiopians makes up only .044% of all immigrants in Scarborough, and 14.8% of all immigrants in Toronto. There are 64,880 first generation-immigrants and 29,340 second-generation immigrants, and 6,975 citizens in Scarborough between the ages of 15 to 19. (Statistics Canada., 2017) Therefore if 25% of teenagers in Ontario report having used marijuana this represents 1,744 teens in Scarborough 80 of which are immigrant, while 58% or 4,045 teens report having abused alcohol at an adolescent age, 186 are immigrant. 

2.2.	Brampton
There are 1,020 Italian immigrants in Brampton vs 45,515 in all of Toronto. With a total of 47,965 immigrants in Brampton, Italians make up 2.1% of the population. There are 29,585 second-generation immigrant’s vs 740,180 in all of Toronto. There are 6,690 citizens between the age of 15 to 19. (Statistics Canada., 2017) Therefore 1,673 or 25% of teens in Brampton have smoked marijuana and 82 of which are immigrants, while of the 3,880 or 58% that have reported to have abused alcohol, 190 are immigrants. 

3.	Cultural Integration and Representation
Despite the party lifestyle portrayed by The Weeknd’s music, he has contributed to the preservation of his culture in Canada. Whether intentional or not, he has strengthened the multicultural bonds and diversity that make Canada and Toronto the multicultural demographics that they are. In 2016 he contributed $50,000 to the University of Toronto to help start an Ethiopic Studies program (Carissimo, Justin., 2016). Additionally, he has donated over $50,000 to the St. Mary Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and community that he attended while growing up in Toronto. He is praised by many for his philanthropic contributions to the preservation and education of Ethiopian Culture and Heritage. While Alessia hasn’t yet achieve the same level of success and philanthropy that The Weeknd has, she uses her success to defend her identity and stand up for multiculturalism in Canada. By being vocal about her Italian-Canadian upbringing, and actively opposing the exclusive nature of the Italian immigrant community that raised her. (Van Evra, Jennifer, 2018) Alessia is working to change the mindset of first-generation Italian immigrants from that of a separatist view to more of an assimilation, and perhaps one day integration. (J. W. Berry., 2001)

Conclusion
Good music draws on influence from many different styles, tastes, and personalities, and some of the most influential music combines genres and techniques from all over the world. Music is a function of broadcasting your influences and experiences, and successful music is that which can resonate with the largest audience possible. With 58% of youth between the ages of 15 and 19 in Ontario reporting some form of alcohol addiction or abuse and 25% reporting the use of marijuana, it is no wonder that we have teen pop stars emerging out of some of Canada’s most densely populated areas singing anthems, or anti-anthems, of party culture. However, this is nothing new. Every generation has had its sex, drugs, and rock and roll anthems, and this one is no different. What is different is the rise of immigrant representation within those anthems. As the creation of music allows for a departure from materialism, from the affects of status, and preconceived notions surrounding us – and for an immigrant, music could be their primary way of inclusively defining their Canadian identity.

Appendix 
This research is intended to be read by Ramesh Sangha, is a member of parliament representing Brampton Center, or his office. Attached is a research project which reports on findings between the representation of immigrants in Canadian identity through music. The document is laid out in 3 major sections. In the first section I dissect the messages and meaning behind some of the artists music, looking for calls to specific influences that they might have mentioned in their songs which would give me an indication as to what their experience might have been growing up in specific urban centers around the city. The second section analyzes the statistics of those regions, and substance abuse trends for the age groups that the artists would have associated with around the time of the rise in their popularity. Investigating the population sizes, first or second-generation immigrant populations, statistics on the use of marijuana and alcohol for those urban centers, and then combining the statistics to represent the relationship to immigrants. The final section includes pop culture references and looks to determine how the artists use their influence to promote multiculturalism as an identity in Canada. Initially it was very difficult to narrow down my selections of artists, as it meant filtering first those who were second-generation immigrants, and then listening to all of their music for themes referencing specific immigrant issues or experiences. Once I had discovered a theme, the next challenge was to research the history of the artists and all of their songs to determine how this theme related to their experience growing up in Toronto as a second-generation immigrant, and also what it meant to them to be from Toronto. The final challenge was to assemble the statistics required to support the theme described by the artists. Further research might try to determine why there is such a prominent party scene amongst youth in this country, and whether or not artist could be using their position to promote better alternatives to cope with the challenges of growing up and discovering an identity.
